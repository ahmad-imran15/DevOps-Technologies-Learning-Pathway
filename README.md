This repository is associated with two insightful blogs that showcase my journey I learned during the DevOps Course FALL-2024, taught by @Saim Safdar.

# Blog Summary
[NU Timetable: Simplifying Timetable Management for FAST University Students and Faculty](https://medium.com/@ahmad-imran/nu-timetable-simplifying-timetable-management-for-fast-university-students-and-faculty-aa058232e162)

This blog highlights the creation of the NU Timetable app, designed for computing students and faculty at FAST University. It explains how the app addresses inefficiencies in the traditional Google Sheets-based system by offering features like timetable display, free slot search, and reminders. The article provides an overview of the appâ€™s functionality, user-centric design, and impact on enhancing academic productivity.

[Mastering Kubernetes Application Management with Helm](https://medium.com/@ahmad-imran/nu-timetable-simplifying-timetable-management-for-fast-university-students-and-faculty-aa058232e162)

In this blog, I delve into Kubernetes application management using Helm. It covers the basics of Helm charts, their role in simplifying application deployment, and their integration within Kubernetes environments. The article serves as a guide for leveraging Helm to efficiently manage containerized applications, making it a valuable resource for developers and DevOps enthusiasts.
